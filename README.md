# VITUDIO-L.-Pi-Formula-2BSCSA-Computational-Science
**Description**
- A simple Python script to test "Floating Point Error." It basically shows what happens and the difference in terms of accuracy and propagation between truncating and rounding off.

- It calculates the surface area of a Sphere (A=4πr^2) using a precise version of Pi, with more than 100 digits, as the basis/answer key. Then it compares Truncating vs. Rounding to see how much accuracy you actually lose.
